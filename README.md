## Built With

- Languages: _**HTML, CSS, JavaScript**_
- Frameworks: _**N/A**_
- Technologies used: _**GIT, GITHUB, LINTERS**_

## I used the following guidelines from the template.

- **Colors**. 
- **Typography**: COCOGOOSE and Lato as fonts, size and weight.
- **Layout**: composition and space between elements.
- The pages look almost identical to the original design.

## I built these 2 pages:

- The home page.
- The about page.

## Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:

- **Mobile**: up to 768px wide.
- **Desktop**: 768px or wider.

## Interactions:

- The home page has a link in the menu to the about page.
- The logo in the header links to the home page.
- **Mobile menu**
   - When the user clicks the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
   - The mobile menu has a close (X) button that closes the menu.
- **Dynamic page**
   - The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
   - You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
